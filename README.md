osx_handmade
============

A port of Handmade Hero (http://handmadehero.org) for OS X.

This repository has been merged into the osx_handmade repository
at https://github.com/itfrombit/osx_handmade.

The osx_handmade repository does not require Xcode or any nib/xib files,
so it adopts the "minimal" original intent of this repository.
